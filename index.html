            <h2>Help</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Dreamlings Idle, a buggy text-based creature collector that is all about waiting. The majority, but not all, of this game was created
                with tremendous help from several AIs. For this reason, because the dev is not actually a dev but just someone who has a hoarding problem, it is
                probably rather buggy. There are also no images in this game, but there are a few emojis. Does that count? No, suppose not.</p>
            <p>If you clicked away the popups meant to help you, here is what they said for you to read while you wait.</p>
            <h3>Dreamlings Tab</h3>
            <p>Here live your current Dreamlings: your active party, your training Dreamlings and your storage. Party Dreamlings give bonuses and gain experience 
                every second. The Dreamlings you put in training gain twice the experience, but give no bonuses. The ones in your storage don't gain experience 
                and they don't give bonuses. You start with 500 storage, but you can increase your storage later. Every party member gives you 0.5 experience per 
                second, so try to keep a full party at all times.</p>
            <h3>Exporting/Trading</h3>
            <p>Exporting creates a QR code (or, if that fails, a regular text code), which you can use to trade with other people. There is not much point in trading 
                with yourself, because beyond a "TRADED" banner and collection purposes, there are no benefits. The codes are valid for 24h after generation, so you 
                can't just export everything and keep them indefinitely if you run out of storage. You can use the same code once every 24h, but you can use as many 
                codes as you want. If you'd like to trade, check out the Discord link in the Settings tab and join us!</p>
            <h3>Wild Areas Tab</h3>
            <p>You start with the Forest area, where you can find ~50 random Dreamlings out of the 650 base ones. These are different for everyone. You will need 
                Event Vouchers to temporarily access the Event area, or purchase access from the Token Shop with Quest Tokens. Search for a wild Dreamling, which costs 
                1 energy, and then click "tame". Taming takes some time, depending on the rarity. You can only tame 1 at a time, so choose carefully. Wild Dreamlings 
                will disappear after some time (10-15 minutes), so don't spend all your energy at once unless you plan on leaving for a while and letting it regenerate. 
                Energy regens 1 every 10 minutes and starts off with max 30, but you can increase this.</p>
            <h3>Special Dreamlings/Stars</h3>
            <P>Every time you search, you have a 0.5 base chance of encountering a star Dreamling. These are special variants, though really their only benefit is that 
                they have double the max level of their regular variant. You can raise your base star chance with upgrades and Dreamling bonuses, but it's capped at 
                5% total.</P>
            <h3>Event Area</h3>
            <p>Every month, 30 new species are added that you can collect for that month only. These are limited edition for now, meaning they aren't set to return 
                afterwards, so get them while you can. If you're aiming to collect all of them, a tip is to collect at least the Common T1's of each and preferably 
                the Uncommon T1's as well, to make things easier on yourself. With the Dream Book and a lot of levelling and fusions and some luck, you will be able 
                to work your way up through every Dreamling species.</p>
            <h3>Fusion Lab</h3>
            <p>When you have level 25 Dreamlings that have the same rarity and tier, you can fuse them. Upon success you will get a higher tier, a higher rarity or both. 
                The selected Dreamlings will disappear and the result will appear in your storage, starting over at level 1. Failure to fuse will make the Dreamlings 
                tired and mean you will have to wait 30 minutes to try again. You are able to get star Dreamlings from regular fusion. Fusing a star and a regular 
                Dreamling will result in a 50% chance of a star, while fusing two stars will always give another star.</p>
            <h3>Dream Book</h3>
            <p>Every single Dreamling you have ever collected appears here. You can buy collected Dreamlings for Dream Points. The price depends on the rarity and the 
                tier, and events are three times as expensive. This can help you finish a collection, if that's what you want to work on. The base rate for Dream Points 
                is 1 per second, per party member. You are able to get star Dreamlings from Dream Book purchases.</p>
            <h3>Upgrades Tab</h3>
            <p>Buy upgrades with Research Points and Gold. You gain 0.1 Research Point per second from each party member and then 0.1-0.5 Research Points per second from 
                released Dreamlings, depending on the rarity. Once you have accumulated some Dream Points, you could buy cheap Common T1's from the Dream Book for 100k 
                each and release them for 0.1 Research Points per second. Gold comes from collectibles, which you get from chests in the Collection tab.</p>
            <h3>Quests</h3>
            <p>Every day you get 5 quests, which are repeatable 5 times. Progress doesn't carry over between repeats, so claim them immediately. You get Quest Tokens 
                from every completed quest and a small bit of gold that is mostly meant to help you get started on the Upgrades rather than provide you with a proper 
                amount.</p>
            <h3>Token Shop</h3>
            <p>Buy consumables with Quest Tokens. The effects are immediately applied, so if for example you buy 6h event access, you get it immediately. The 
                chests you purchase will be in the Collection tab, same as other chests. You can only have one temporary boost running at a time!</p>
            <h3>Collection/Chests</h3>
            <p>There are 5000 collectibles you can collect, each with their own rarity and a gold per second value based on that. You get 1 chest every 10 minutes 
                to start with, with max 30 at a time, but you can increase this limit in the Upgrades. You can get Event Vouchers and Max Potions from chests at a 
                0.5% rate with a pity counter set to 200, so make sure to open these when you can.</p>
            <h3>Trophy Hall/Ascension</h3>
            <p>Fusing two Legendary T5 Dreamlings will always result in a star Legendary T5. Get it to level 1000 with a Max Potion and then you get the option of 
                ascending it. Ascension removes the Dreamling from regular gameplay, but adds it to the Trophy Hall and its boosts become permanent, as though you 
                have it in your party. Normally Legendaries have their boosts capped at level 250, but with ascension this becomes level 333. Not only will you free 
                up a party slot by ascending a star Legendary T5 Dreamling, you will also get higher boosts from them, which definitely makes it worth it.</p>
